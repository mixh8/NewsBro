More details regarding a possible deal between Israel and Hamas, facilitated by the U.S., emerged on Saturday.

A tentative deal to pause the conflict for at least five days in exchange for the release of dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza is near agreement, according to The Washington Post.

The outlet previously reported on the potential deal, citing an Arab diplomat, but the details remained foggy at the time. New information suggests that Israel may agree to the deal, and the first substantial pause in fighting could now begin in days.

The six-page agreement reportedly stipulates that around 50 hostages would begin to be released every 24 hours. It’s believed that about 239 hostages remain in Hamas’ hands. Overhead surveillance would be employed to ensure the deal is adhered to, therefore allowing for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, notes the Post.

Israel had previously agreed to daily pauses of around four to five hours to let aid enter for the Palestinian people but has staunchly refused to consider any significant pauses until hostages are freed.

In Saturday comments, White House adviser Brett McGurk said a hostage release would lead to a “massive surge” in humanitarian relief.

“The surge in humanitarian relief, the surge in fuel, the pause in fighting will come with hostages are released,” he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden have echoed similar sentiments, but both have dismissed the possibility of a cease-fire, instead discussing the option of “tactical pauses.”
